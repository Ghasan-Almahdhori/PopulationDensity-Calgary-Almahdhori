Title: Indicator Analysis Workflow – Population Density and Car Dependency in CalgaryAuthor: Ghassan Saleh AlmahdhoriDate: 2025-11-02Software: ArcGIS Online (Web GIS Environment)Description:This folder documents the analytical process used to relate population density and public-transit dependency across Calgary communities.Methods Summary:1. Population density was calculated by joining 2019 Census population data to Calgary community polygons and dividing total population by land area (km²).2. The “Mode of Transportation to Work” layer (2021 Census) was joined to the same community polygons using a common field (community name).3. A choropleth symbology was applied to population density (blue gradient) with proportional circles for public transit percentage (green).4. Data classification used equal-interval breaks for density and graduated symbols for transit mode share.5. The resulting map was exported as a GeoTIFF (density_transit_choropleth_calgary.tif) for inclusion in this data package.Key Insights:- Low-density suburban communities show very low public-transit use, reflecting high car dependency.- Inner-city and higher-density communities exhibit higher transit percentages and lower car reliance.- The spatial pattern supports the conclusion that compact urban form enables sustainable mobility.CRS and Projection:All analysis conducted in NAD 1983 CSRS Alberta 10-TM (EPSG: 3403).Tools Used:ArcGIS Online – Map Viewer, Spatial Join, Attribute Table Editor, Symbolization, and Export Tools.License:This workflow documentation is licensed under CC BY 4.0.
